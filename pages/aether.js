                To address caregivers' paperwork challenges, the app
                <strong> Aether</strong> was developed. It is an app that
                combines intuitive UX/UI design with AI technology to streamline
                paperwork. Using Optical Image Recognition and GPT-4, it
                simplifies complex paperwork in clear and easy-to-understand
                language. It also enables autofill with stored information in
                the app. The app's design minimizes cognitive load, saving time
                and reducing burnout, so caregivers can focus on providing high
                quality care.

              The intial version of the high fidelity wireframe and prototype
              incorporated the colour palette and typography. This version
              included detailed visuals, such as colors, typography, icons, and
              interactive elements, to create the look for the final product.

                <li>
                  <strong>Accessibility fell short: </strong> 60% of caregivers
                  found that the text colour and background colour were too
                  similair and made it hard to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Visuals felt too outdated: </strong> Other designers
                  that looked at the app felt like it looked too outdated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              This iteration of the app served as a testing ground. The next
              iteration of the app was designed with the feedback in mind.

              After taking in the feedback from the intial high fidelity
              wireframes, improvements were made. For the final design, the
              decision to have a <strong> lighter background </strong>
              and <strong> more contrasting buttons</strong> made the app more
              accesible. Adjustments to the pages of the app made it look more

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>A/B testing:</strong> Caregivers found the app much
                  more accessible on the new iteration. Complaints about
                  readability fell from 60% to 10%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Designer feedback:</strong> Designers thought the new
                  iteration was much more pleasing to the eye and the
                  accessbility and usability were still at the forefront of the
                  design.

              Time to complete paperwork fell from 7 minutes to 4 minutes.

            <p>
              Without Aether, the average time to fill out paperwork was 7
              minutes for a single page. After having caregivers and many other
              users use the app, time to fill out a single page of paperwork
              fell to <strong>4 minutes, a drop of ~42%.</strong> Users
              particularly liked the paraphrasing feature of the app which
              simplifies complex wording making it easier to understand what
              information is required. <br />
              By cutting down on time spent on paperwork, Aether empowers
              caregivers to work more efficiently, ultimately reducing burnout
              and allowing them to focus on what matters most, high quality
              caregiving.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>User-centric design is essential: </strong>
                The feedback from user testing highlighted the importance of
                designing with the end-user in mind. Their feedback and insights
                were what shaped the app into something that addresses the
                caregivers needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility matters: </strong>
                Ensuring the app was accesible and easy to navigate was curcial.
                The adjustments made on user feedback significantly improved
                user experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Balancing aesthetic and Functionality: </strong>
                While designing an eye pleasing app was important, it was
                equally as important maintian the functionality and accessiblity
                of the app.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className={styles.finalhead}>Areas for Improvement:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Expand user testing: </strong>
                Conducting more extensive user testing with a more diverse group
                of caregivers could uncover additional pain points.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microinteractions: </strong>
                Incorporating some sublte microinteractions can make the app
                feel more responsive and engaging.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className={styles.finalhead}>Reflection:</h3>
            <div className={styles.conclude_content}>
              My time working on Aether was a great experience that allowed me
              to grow as a designer, developer, and marketer. I gained valuable
              insights into cross-functional collaboration with multiple teams,
              navigating challenges, and designing and developing a successful
              product. While the development of the app was successful, it was
              not without and setbacks.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Effective communication is important when it come to fostering
                  a collaborative environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adaptability is essential, as projects often evolve and
                  flexibility is required in order to adjust for the obstacles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Desgin is an interative process, and adjustments are a natural
                  part of refining and developing a good user experience
                </li>
                <li>
                  Having fun in the creative process is just as important as
                  achieving the end result.
                </li>
              </ul>
              These takeaways have not only helped me hone my skills as a
              designer and team member, it also let me experience and show my
              appreciation for product development.
