                Caregivers face significant challenges with <strong>repetitive</strong>,

                This task can be done more effeciently, yet caregivers are still struggling with it due to ineffecient tools.
                By making paperwork more efficient, it enhances the caregiver experience by reducing stress and freeing up time

                To address caregivers' paperwork challenges, my team and I developed <strong>Aether</strong> an app that combines intuitive
                UX/UI design with AI technology to streamline paperwork. Using Optical Image Recognition and GPT-4, it simplifies complex
                paperwork in clear and easy-to-understand language. It also enables autofill with stored information in the app. The app's
                design minimizes cognitive load, saving time and reducing burnout, so caregivers can focus on providing high quality care.

              is the caregiver of his mother at home. By creating these personas, we can understand the needs
              of the caregiver to ensure the product is designed to be easy to use and reduce the learning curve of it.

              While existing tools provided basic functionality, we aimed to design an app 
              that was not only intuitive but also aligned with the specific needs of caregivers. 
              Our focus was on crafting a user experience that felt thoughtful and seamless for those
