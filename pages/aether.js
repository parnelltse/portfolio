              Aether is an app created to help caregivers with paperwork. At its core, it uses AI to

              to reduce burnout and save time to allow caregivers to focus on what matters most, providing high

                Caregivers face significant challenges with <strong>repetitive</strong>,
                <strong> stressful</strong>, and <strong> time-consuming</strong> paperwork
                which affects their ability to focus on providing quality care to seniors.
                This task can be done more effeciently, yet caregivers are still struggling with it due to ineffecient tools.
                By making paperwork more efficient, it enhances the caregiver experience by reducing stress and freeing up time
                but also directly improves senior care outcomes, allowing caregivers to focus on what matters most, providing compassing and support for seniors

                To address caregivers' paperwork challenges, my team and I developed <strong>Aether</strong> an app that combines intuitive
                UX/UI design with AI technology to streamline paperwork. Using Optical Image Recognition and GPT-4, it simplifies complex
                paperwork in clear and easy-to-understand language. It also enables autofill with stored information in the app. The app's
                design minimizes cognitive load, saving time and reducing burnout, so caregivers can focus on providing high quality care.

              To get a better understanding of the target audience, I conducted research with caregivers who will use the

              Based on the research, I created two user personas. The primary persona is of a
              full-time senior home caregiver and the secondary persona is an office worker who
              is the caregiver of his mother at home. By creating these personas, we can understand the needs
              of the caregiver to ensure the product is designed to be easy to use and reduce the learning curve of it.
