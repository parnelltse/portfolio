                To address caregivers' paperwork challenges, my team and I developed <strong>Aether</strong> an app that combines intuitive
                UX/UI design with AI technology to streamline paperwork. Using Optical Image Recognition and GPT-4, it simplifies complex
                paperwork in clear and easy-to-understand language. It also enables autofill with stored information in the app. The app's
                design minimizes cognitive load, saving time and reducing burnout, so caregivers can focus on providing high quality care.

              After getting the prototype tested and validated, we found areas that needed adjustment in the app.
              The users found the intial prototype too blue. With a lack of contrast, some users found it difficult
              to find certain buttons. The users also said some screens looked out-of-date, recommending that we
              give the app a more modern facelift. For the final design, we decided to have a lighter background
              and more contrasting buttons but still keeping our initial colour palette. We also added a more modern
              design onto some of the pages while still keeping the accessibility and user-centric design in mind.
              When validating the app again, users found the accessibility of the app much better and the modern touch
              to it much more pleasing to the eye.

              <li><strong>User-centric design is essential: </strong> 
               The feedback from user testing highlighted the importance of

              what shaped the app into something that addresses the caregivers needs.</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility matters: </strong> 
                Ensuring the app was accesible and easy to navigate was curcial. 
              The adjustments made on user feedback significantly improved user experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Balancing aesthetic and Functionality: </strong>
              While designing an eye pleasing app was important, it was equally as important maintian

                Conducting more extensive user testing with a more diverse group

            <p className={styles.conclude_content}>
              My time working on Aether was a great experience that allowed me to grow as a designer, developer, and marketer. 
              I gained valuable insights into cross-functional collaboration with multiple teams, navigating challenges, and 
              designing and developing a successful product. While the development of the app was successful, it was not without
              and setbacks.
              <ul>
                <li>Effective communication is important when it come to fostering a collaborative environment.</li>
                <li>Adaptability is essential, as projects often evolve and flexibility is required in order to adjust 
                  for the obstacles.</li>
                  <li>Desgin is an interative process, and adjustments are a natural part of refining and developing a good user experience</li>
                  <li>Having fun in the creative process is just as important as achieving the end result.</li>
              </ul>
              These takeaways have not only helped me hone my skills as a designer and team member, it also 
              let me experience and show my appreciation for product development.
